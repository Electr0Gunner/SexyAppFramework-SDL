The PopCap Games Framework provides interfaces to some third-party 
libraries, but licenses to those libraries are not automatically 
granted to you through use of the Framework.  Listed below is 
information for libraries which require explicit licensing if you 
release a product which uses them.

BASS Audio Library
The BASS Audio Library is the default library used by the Framework 
to decompress sounds and to play music.  Licenses to the BASS Audio 
Library can be purchased at http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html#license.

MP3 Compressed Audio
The Framework supports both MP3 and OGG decompression through either 
BASS or OpenAL.  The OGG format can be used for free, but if you must 
use MP3 in your product, you will have to contact Thompson Multimedia 
and arrange to pay for an MP3 license.  Game developers can get a 
'game license' to use MP3 for $2500.  See 
http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/games.html.

Macromedia Flash
The Framework supports Flash through FlashWidget, but you must sign 
up for a license to redistribute the Flash ActiveX control if you 
use FlashWidget in your application.  You can get a Flash license 
from Macromedia at 
http://www.macromedia.com/support/shockwave/info/licensing/main_2.html.
Make sure you actually read the license, particularly the 
"Consideration" section.
